# Back To Basics
A front-end themed learning app which uses a unique spaced repetition inspired algorithm
## You can explore the app [here](https://clever-rosalind-0fcb2a.netlify.com/) 

## What does it do?
As most new developers(and older ones) know all too well, learning the amount of information we do in the relatively short time span can be demanding. It becomes increasingly easy to forget about the front-end web development fundamentals.
We seek to remedy that problem using the spaced repetition learning technique. Our learning app integrates a broad mixture of HTML/CSS/JavaScript related questions.
## Technologies used
- Coffee
- Mocha & Chai for testing
- Chris & Casey for sanity
- Travis CI
- JWT(JSON Web Token)
- Passport.js
- mLab
- React
- Redux
- Thunk
- Netlify
- Heroku
- Node
- Express
- Singly linked list data structure
- GitHub
- Coffee

## How it works
- Our algorithm adds "weights" to questions so questions you answer correctly will decrease in frequency while ones you struggle with will be shown more often.

- We've chosen to use a linked list due to the ease at which you can insert items at the middle of it compared to arrays.

- We use the "weights" to determine how far back in the list we move the question.
